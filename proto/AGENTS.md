# Instructions for Agents Working in `proto/`

Protobuf definitions feed persisted state, generated Go/TypeScript bindings,
ConnectRPC services, and the public API reference.

## Public API Protos

For public API packages:

- Follow [chatto/api/v1/AGENTS.md](chatto/api/v1/AGENTS.md) for public
  ConnectRPC API consistency rules.
- Follow [chatto/admin/v1/AGENTS.md](chatto/admin/v1/AGENTS.md) for
  administrative ConnectRPC API consistency rules.
- Follow [chatto/realtime/v1/AGENTS.md](chatto/realtime/v1/AGENTS.md) for the
  realtime WebSocket protobuf protocol.
- Write comments for API consumers, not Chatto maintainers.
- Every public service, RPC, message, enum, enum value, and important field
  should have useful comments.
- Explain what the call reads or changes, required IDs, pagination/cursor
  semantics, login availability, and notable response behavior.
- Keep field comments short enough for generated tables; put longer behavior
  notes on messages or RPCs.
- Do not include maintainer workflow text such as "run codegen" in comments that
  render into public docs.

## Compatibility

- Do not renumber fields that may be persisted or consumed by clients.
- Do not change a field type at an existing tag. Add a new tag instead.
- Removing a persisted field requires both `reserved <tag>` and
  `reserved "<name>"`.
- Renames are wire-safe but code-breaking; update generated consumers in the
  same change.
- Persisted protobufs in `EVT`, `RUNTIME_STATE`, `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`, and object
  metadata need additive evolution plus repair/migration code when existing data
  changes shape.
- Transient live-event protos are less stable, but `chatto/realtime/v1` is still
  a public wire protocol and must consider mixed-version clients.

## Presence And API Shape

- For public API messages under `chatto/api/v1`, `chatto/admin/v1`, and
  `chatto/realtime/v1`, use proto3 `optional` scalar fields when clients must
  distinguish absent/unhydrated/unknown from a scalar default.
- Avoid parallel `*_present` booleans for simple scalar presence.
- Use enums or oneofs only when modeling multiple meaningful availability states.

## Code Generation

- Public `.proto` or ConnectRPC service changes require `mise codegen-proto`.
- Commit all generated Go/TypeScript bindings and docs-website ConnectRPC
  reference outputs.
- New public services also need generated docs grouping in
  `tools/split-connectrpc-docs.mjs`; the splitter fails codegen when a service
  is not assigned to a reference page.
- New generated reference pages need docs sidebar entries in
  `apps/docs-website/astro.config.mjs`.
