# Instructions for Agents

### Documentation

Please refer to this repository's README.md for general information.

This codebase keeps agent-relevant context in six places. Read the one that fits your task:

- **`.claude/rules/**`** — always-on coding, testing, and review conventions, mostly path-scoped (`frontend.md` and `frontend-conventions.md` for SvelteKit work, `backend.md` for Go, `testing-frontend.md` / `testing-backend.md` for tests, `authorization.md` for permission changes, etc.). Start here for "how do we do things in this repo?"
- **`.agents/skills/**`** — opt-in agent skills for repeated workflows. Use `svelte-core-bestpractices` together with the Svelte MCP tools when writing, editing, or reviewing Svelte components and modules.
- **`docs/fdr/INDEX.md`** — **Feature** Decision Records, one per feature. They describe what a feature does *and* why it's designed that way. Read the relevant FDR before changing user-facing behavior.
- **`docs/adr/INDEX.md`** — **Architecture** Decision Records. Cross-cutting choices like "NATS as primary data store" or "per-user encryption keys with crypto-shredding". Read when touching architectural seams.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — inventory of what currently exists (streams, KV buckets, subject patterns, GraphQL operations). Use when you need to know *what's where*, not *why*.
- **`docs/GLOSSARY.md`** — one-line definitions of Chatto-specific terms (Server, Space, Echo, OCC, etc.). Skim when you encounter a word you don't recognize.

### Project Status

Please use the following facts when making decisions about features or implementation:

- This project is currently in early development.
- As of today, we have a handful of Chatto servers running the 0.0.x version lane that we want to eventually upgrade to 0.1.x. 0.1.x must be able to reliably import data from a 0.0.x server.
- There are no servers deployed running 0.1.x yet, so we can still do breaking changes within this version lane.
- The focus of 0.1.x is on stabilizing the core data model and APIs, improving documentation, and building out a solid foundation for future features. We want to avoid adding new features that aren't necessary for this stabilization effort.
- Treat `GET /api/server` as a higher-stability compatibility surface than the GraphQL API. It is the unauthenticated, cross-origin discovery endpoint used by multi-server clients before they can establish GraphQL access, so breaking its URL, CORS behavior, required JSON fields, or OAuth discovery fields can strand older clients. Prefer additive changes and double-check compatibility before changing this endpoint.

Please update this section as the project evolves, and refer to it when making decisions about features or implementation.

### When making changes...

- Please keep ADRs, FDRs, and other documentation (glossary, docs-website, architecture inventory) up to date.
- Before pushing a branch for a PR, make sure it is named something descriptive of the change.

### Issues, Commits, and PRs

- Use this project's GitHub Issues for planning work.
- Use Conventional Commit format in commit messages.
- Use Conventional Commit format in PR titles. PR bodies should include a bullet list of changes, ideally with links to relevant FDRs, ADRs, and glossary terms.
- When creating or editing multiline GitHub PR/issue bodies with `gh`, write real Markdown to a file/stdin and use `--body-file`. Do not pass escaped `\n` sequences to `--body`; they render literally. Afterward, verify the stored body with `gh pr view --json body --jq .body` or equivalent before telling the user the PR is ready.
- Please keep ADRs and FDRs up to date.
- When the PR closes an issue, please include this information in the PR title or body (e.g. "Fixes #123") so GitHub can link and auto-close them.

### General Coding and Design Guidelines

- Prefer simplicity and clarity over cleverness.
- Where feasible, write code comments that explain intent.
- Make sure the code is well-tested, and that tests are easy to understand and maintain.
