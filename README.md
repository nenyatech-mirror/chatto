# chatto

A really good chat application for teams and communities, free and easy to self-host, with [cloud hosting available](https://chatto.run/cloud).

## Warning: Alpha Software 🚧

While Chatto is moving forward at a rapid pace, we can't yet give any guarantees about stability, security, or performance; we also at this point can't support data migrations.

We are providing the source code here for transparency and to allow early adopters to experiment and provide feedback. If you choose to actually run it, **be prepared to lose some or all of your data at any time**.

A lot of projects say this and people often ignore it, so let me spell things out a bit more:

- You **will** lose runtime and permission configuration and will be required to manually fix things.
- You **will** lose data for experimental features that we decide to remove or significantly change.
- You **will** experience breaking changes in the GraphQL API.
- You **will** lose user and message data to bugs, or if we need to make breaking changes to the data model.

It should be no surprise that we are working hard to move towards a release that can give better guarantees, but we're not there yet.

## Development with Conductor

[Conductor](https://conductor.build) workspaces run the dev stack natively via `mise dev` — no Docker. The `run` script in `conductor.json` wires Conductor's assigned `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` (and `+1` / `+2`) into the env vars `mise dev` reads:

| Port              | Process                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` | Vite dev server (user-facing URL)    |
| `+1`              | Go backend (`CHATTO_WEBSERVER_PORT`) |
| `+2`              | Embedded NATS                        |

Outside Conductor, plain `mise dev` uses the defaults from `cli/chatto.toml` (Vite 5173, backend 4000, NATS 4555).

Each instance is bootstrapped with the same dev credentials (configured in `cli/chatto.toml` under `[[bootstrap.users]]`):

- **Login:** `alice`
- **Email:** `alice@example.com`
- **Password:** `foobar123`
