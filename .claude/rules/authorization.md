# Authorization Model

This document describes the authorization requirements and policies for Chatto's GraphQL API.

## Core Principles

1. **Users are bound to a server** - All users exist within a single Chatto server
2. **Spaces are discoverable** - Users can browse all spaces for discovery purposes. To make a server fully private, place it behind a reverse-proxy auth layer or disable the `Query.spaces` / `Query.space(id)` resolvers via a future configuration flag — the GraphQL gateway alone cannot enforce private-server discovery.
3. **Room access requires space membership** - Users must join a space before accessing its rooms
4. **Message access requires room membership** - Users can only read/write messages in rooms they've joined
5. **User profiles are public** - Basic user info (id, login, displayName, avatar) is visible to all authenticated users
6. **Membership info is private** - Users can only see their own space/room memberships

## Authorization Architecture

Authorization is enforced at the **API boundary**, not in core:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **GraphQL** | User-facing API. Checks authorization via `Can*` functions before calling core. |
| **Core** | Pure business logic. Assumes caller is authorized. Documents requirements in comments. |
| **NATS** | Extension/internal API. Trusted context, calls core directly. |

**Why this design:**
- Core functions are reusable from trusted contexts (NATS handlers, background jobs)
- No redundant permission checks when core calls other core functions
- Clear separation: GraphQL handles user authorization, core handles business logic
- Audit logging can be added orthogonally without coupling to authorization

## Permission System

Permissions are granted through roles assigned to space members. Use `Can*` functions in `core/can.go` to check permissions.

### Resolution Algorithm

Permission resolution is a single unified walker. Position numbers run **everyone=0** at the bottom up to **owner=1000** at the top (higher number = more power). For each permission check, the resolver applies the following phases in order; the first decision wins.

**Phase 0 — DM boundary deny-list.** In DM rooms, the permissions in `dmBoundaryDeniedPermissions` (privacy/category-mismatch) are denied unconditionally regardless of any grant. See "DM Privacy Boundary" below.

**Phase 1 — User-level overrides.** Explicit grants/denies attached directly to the user (KV subject = the userID) are checked next. Room scope before server scope. **User-level decisions outrank every role grant.** Use these for:
- *Suspension*: deny a perm directly to one user → they're blocked even if their roles grant it.
- *Ad-hoc grants*: grant `message.delete-any` to one user in one room without inventing a role for it.

**Phase 2 — Role hierarchy walk.** Roles are walked in **descending position order** (highest rank first). For each role, room-scope decisions are probed before server-scope. The first allow/deny wins; lower-ranked roles aren't consulted further.

There is no "bypass" short-circuit. Owners pass permission checks because the owner role is seeded with every server-scope permission via `DefaultOwnerPermissions` (the same set as admin), not because the resolver special-cases them. Any deny configured by an operator applies uniformly — including to owners. The owner / admin distinction is enforced through rank, not through capability.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **A higher-ranked role's grant overrides a lower-ranked role's deny.** Patterns like an `#announcements` room (deny on `everyone`, grant on `moderator`) work because moderator is checked first.
- **Within a single subject, room-scope overrides server-scope.** Same-subject specificity.
- **There is no deny-always-wins floor at the role level.** An operator who wants to forbid an action across the board should deny on the highest-ranked role that should be affected — or attach a per-user deny.
- **Default-deny.** If no phase emits a decision, the result is "no decision" — treated as deny at the API boundary.

**Testing implication:** Denying a permission on `everyone` does NOT block users with higher-rank roles. To test permission denial, deny on the user's actual highest-rank role, attach a user-level deny, or deny on a higher-ranked role.

### Position numbering

| Role | Position | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `everyone` | 0 | Implicit role every authenticated user holds |
| custom roles | 1..99 | `GetNextAvailablePosition` and `ReorderRoles` slot custom roles below moderator by default; operators can promote them via reorder |
| `moderator` | 100 | System role |
| `admin` | 900 | System role |
| `owner` | 1000 | System role; holds the same enumerated permission set as `admin`. Distinct via rank only. |

Wide gaps between system roles leave room for custom roles to be positioned at any rank without renumbering existing ones. Same-position roles resolve deterministically via stable sort + role-name secondary key. System roles can't be reordered or have their positions changed via the public API.

### DM Privacy Boundary

DM rooms use the same hierarchy walker as channels, with one extra rule: a static set of permissions is *unconditionally denied* in DM contexts regardless of role grants. See `dmBoundaryDeniedPermissions` in `permission_resolver.go`. Two reasons appear:

- **Privacy** — owners/admins/moderators cannot moderate DM contents (`message.edit-any`, `message.delete-any`, `room.manage`, `message.echo`).
- **Category mismatch** — DMs have their own listing/creation/membership APIs, so channel-style `room.list` / `room.create` / `member.invite` / `member.remove` don't apply.

Access *to* DM rooms is gated separately by participation (`requireRoomMember`) and the `dm.view` permission at the server boundary. The deny-list only constrains what a participant can do once inside.

### Rank vs Permission: the two-step rule

RBAC has two distinct concepts that are easy to conflate:

- **Permission** — "is this role authorized to perform action X at all?" (capability gate)
- **Rank** — "does the caller outrank the specific target user?" (hierarchy invariant)

**Any mutation that targets another user requires BOTH:**

1. The relevant permission (e.g. `role.assign` for user-admin actions).
2. `OutranksUser(actor, target)` — the actor's highest role must outrank the target's.

Rank alone is **not** an authorization check. A function named `OutranksUser` answers a hierarchy question; it does not gate a capability. Conversely, a permission alone breaks the hierarchy invariant — a moderator with `admin.manage-users` should not be able to rename an owner.

Both checks together: callers use `requireUserAdminTarget` (in `graph/authz.go`) for user-admin mutations like `updateProfile` / `uploadAvatar` / `updateSettings` / `AdminMutations.updateUser`. Self-actions bypass both for identity edits, but NOT for authorization edits — see below.

**Identity edits vs. authorization edits.** A targeted user mutation falls into one of two categories, and the category determines whether self-action is allowed:

- **Identity edits** change data the user could already change about themselves (display name, login, avatar, settings). Self-action is privilege-neutral, so the gate has a self-bypass.
- **Authorization edits** change the user's permission set (`grantUserPermission` / `denyUserPermission` / `clearUserPermissionState`). Self-action would be a privilege boundary change, so the gate has NO self-bypass. The strict-outrank step fails on self by definition, so self-action is impossible by construction.

Picking the wrong helper for an authz mutation is a privilege escalation — verify the category before reusing a helper.

**Helpers:**

- `requireUserAdminTarget` — for identity/role-membership mutations (`updateProfile`, `uploadAvatar`, `updateSettings`, `AdminMutations.updateUser`, `ClearUsernameCooldown`). Requires `role.assign` AND `OutranksUser`. **Has self-bypass.**
- `requireUserPermissionTarget` — for per-user permission grants/denials (`grantUserPermission`, `denyUserPermission`, `clearUserPermissionState`). Requires `role.manage` AND `OutranksUser`. **No self-bypass.** Uses `role.manage` (not `role.assign`) because a direct user grant can attach any permission, including ones not in any role — same trust level as defining role permissions.
- `requireOutranksAuthor` — for message-content moderation (`editMessage` / `deleteMessage` when actor != author). Combined with the permission check (`CanEditAnyMessage` / `CanDeleteAnyMessage`) it enforces "permission AND outranks the author". Prevents a rogue moderator from editing or deleting messages from higher-ranked users.

**Permitted single-step uses:**

- **UI-hint resolvers** that only inform the frontend whether to show an admin affordance. `Server.viewerCanManageUser` is rank-only by design — the frontend uses it to hide buttons, not to permit operations. Backend mutations still enforce the two-step.
- Permission-only checks for non-targeted actions (e.g. `createRoom` just needs `rooms.create`; there is no target user).

**Anti-pattern (avoid):** a helper named `CanManageUser` or `CanAdminTargetUser` that internally implements only the rank check. Naming a function `Can…` implies authorization; the body must reflect that. If a function answers a hierarchy question, name it `OutranksUser`.

### Permission Constant Naming

Permission constants follow the pattern `InstPerm{Category}{Action}` (singular nouns):

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `InstPerm{Category}{Action}` | `InstPermSpaceCreate` | Singular category |
| `InstPermAdmin{Area}{Action}` | `InstPermAdminUsersView` | Admin permissions |
| `InstPermDM{Action}` | `InstPermDMWrite` | DM permissions |

**Common mistakes** (avoid these):
- `InstPermSpacesCreate` → Use `InstPermSpaceCreate` (singular)
- `InstPermDMsWrite` → Use `InstPermDMWrite` (no plural 's')
- `InstPermAdminAccessUsersView` → Use `InstPermAdminUsersView`

The Go constants in `cli/internal/core/permissions.go` are the source of truth. Frontend TypeScript types are generated via `mise codegen-types`.

### Permission String Naming

Permission strings use **hyphens** as word separators (e.g., `message.post-in-thread`, `message.edit-own`, `message.reply-in-thread`). Never use underscores in permission strings.

### Built-in Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `space.manage` | Update space settings (name, description) |
| `space.delete` | Delete the space |
| `roles.manage` | Create/edit/delete roles |
| `roles.assign` | Assign roles to users |
| `members.invite` | Invite new members |
| `members.remove` | Remove members from space |
| `rooms.browse` | View list of rooms in space |
| `rooms.create` | Create new rooms |
| `rooms.manage` | Update/delete any room |
| `rooms.join` | Join existing rooms |

## Implementation Patterns

### GraphQL Resolver with Permission Check
```go
func (r *mutationResolver) CreateRoom(ctx context.Context, input model.CreateRoomInput) (*Room, error) {
    user, err := requireAuth(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Check permission at GraphQL layer
    can, err := r.core.CanCreateRoom(ctx, user.Id, input.SpaceID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if !can {
        return nil, core.ErrPermissionDenied
    }

    // Core function assumes caller is authorized
    return r.core.CreateRoom(ctx, user.Id, input.SpaceID, input.Name, input.Desc)
}
```

### Core Function (no authorization check)
```go
// CreateRoom creates a new room in a space.
// Authorization: Caller must verify CanCreateRoom before calling.
func (c *ChattoCore) CreateRoom(ctx context.Context, actorID, spaceID, name, desc string) (*Room, error) {
    // Business logic only - no permission check here
}
```

### Authentication Helpers (in graph/authz.go)
```go
user, err := requireAuth(ctx)           // Returns authenticated user or error
user, err := requireSpaceMember(ctx, r.core, spaceID)  // + space membership
user, err := requireRoomMember(ctx, r.core, spaceID, roomID)  // + room membership
```

### Self-Only Access Check
```go
if caller.Id != obj.Id {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("access denied: cannot view other users' data")
}
```

## Customizable Permissions

Default member permissions (`rooms.browse`, `rooms.create`, `rooms.join`) can be revoked from the member role. When implementing or modifying permission checks:

1. **Always use the RBAC engine** - Never hardcode permission grants based on role names or "default" lists
2. **Test both grant and revoke** - Permissions must work when granted AND when revoked
3. **Follow the server RBAC pattern** - Use `engine.RoleHasPermission(ctx, RoleMember, permStr)` to check actual KV state

**Anti-pattern (avoid):**
```go
// BAD: Hardcoded bypass that ignores actual role permissions
if isMember && isDefaultPermission(perm) {
    return true, nil  // Bypasses RBAC engine!
}
```

**Correct pattern:**
```go
// GOOD: Always check actual role permissions via RBAC engine
if isMember {
    hasPerm, err := engine.RoleHasPermission(ctx, RoleMember, string(perm))
    if hasPerm {
        return true, nil
    }
}
```

## Server Owner via Config

Owners can be designated via `owners.emails` in `chatto.toml`. After
Phase 5 of #330 there is no special-case fallthrough in the permission
resolver — the config flow materialises a real `owner` role assignment:

- On email verification (registration / OAuth / admin-direct add),
  `addVerifiedEmail` checks the new email against `owners.emails` and
  auto-assigns the `owner` role if it matches. Fresh deployments work
  without a restart.
- For existing deployments, run `chatto reset rbac` after upgrading
  the binary. The command wipes `SERVER_RBAC`, re-seeds the system
  roles plus default permissions, and assigns `owner` to every user
  whose verified email matches `owners.emails`.

Owners pass every permission check through the standard hierarchy
walk (owner is rank 0). They have access to:

- `/admin` routes in the frontend
- `Query.admin` and `Query.users` in GraphQL
- System monitoring data (NATS stats, streams, KV buckets)
- Everything else (the owner role's grants cover all permissions)

See `admin.md` for the role / config-owner narrative.
