# GraphQL Development

gqlgen is schema-first. Follow this workflow for GraphQL changes:

1. Update schema files (`*.graphqls`) first
2. Run `mise codegen-cli` to regenerate Go types/resolvers
3. After frontend query changes, run `mise codegen-frontend`

## Schema Documentation

- Every type must have a type-level description
- Every field must have a description, even "obvious" relationship fields
- Every enum value must have a description explaining its meaning
- Descriptions should be concise (one sentence preferred)
- Include format examples for non-obvious string values (e.g., `"Round-trip time (e.g., '1.234ms')."`)

## Schema Directives

Use gqlgen directives to control code generation:

### `@goField(forceResolver: true)`

Add this to fields that have custom resolvers. This:

- Silences "adding resolver method for X, nothing matched" warnings
- Documents that the field requires a resolver (not auto-bound from protobuf)
- Required for fields that are computed, lazy-loaded, or need authorization

```graphql
type Space {
  id: ID! # Auto-bound from protobuf
  rooms: [Room!]! @goField(forceResolver: true) # Requires resolver
  viewerIsMember: Boolean! @goField(forceResolver: true) # Computed field
}
```

### `@goModel(model: "...")`

Bind a GraphQL type to a specific Go type:

```graphql
scalar Time @goModel(model: "hmans.de/chatto/internal/graph.Time")
```

## Unions vs Interfaces

**Prefer unions over interfaces** for polymorphic types. This project uses unions (like `EventType`, `NotificationItem`) rather than interfaces:

- **Union**: Simpler Go models - only need `IsTypeName()` marker method
- **Interface**: Requires getter methods for all shared fields in Go

With unions, clients check `__typename` and use inline fragments to query fields:

```graphql
# Union requires inline fragments for ALL fields (including shared ones)
query {
  notifications {
    __typename
    ... on DMMessageNotificationItem {
      id
      createdAt
      actor {
        id
      }
      summary
      room {
        id
      }
    }
    ... on MentionNotificationItem {
      id
      createdAt
      actor {
        id
      }
      summary
      space {
        id
      }
      room {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom Model Files

When gqlgen's auto-binding doesn't work (e.g., types needing internal fields for resolvers), create custom models in `cli/internal/graph/model/`. Keep these minimal:

```go
type MyCustomType struct {
    ID      string `json:"id"`
    // Internal fields for resolvers (not exposed in GraphQL)
    ActorID string `json:"-"`
}

func (MyCustomType) IsMyUnion() {}  // Union marker method
```

## Type Compatibility

When autobind can't match protobuf types to GraphQL types, you'll see warnings like:

- `Time is incompatible with *timestamppb.Timestamp` → Use custom scalar with `@goModel`
- `ID is incompatible with uint64` → Add resolver to convert types
- `adding resolver method for X, nothing matched` → Add `@goField(forceResolver: true)`

## Optimistic UI vs Backend Enforcement

For permission-based UI gating (e.g., "can viewer manage this user?"):

- **Frontend handles optimistic checks** using locally available data (role positions, membership status)
- **Backend enforces authorization** on mutations - the actual security boundary

Don't add `viewer*` boolean fields that require backend round-trips when the frontend already has the data to compute them. Instead:

| ❌ Avoid                                 | ✅ Prefer                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `SpaceMember.viewerCanManage: Boolean!`  | Frontend computes using role positions |
| Fetching permissions for every list item | Query permissions once, apply locally  |

Backend `viewer*` fields are still useful for:

- Complex authorization logic the frontend can't replicate
- Fallback when local data isn't available
- API-level authorization (e.g., `Space.viewerCanManageUser(userId)` for mutations)

## Prefer Core Types Over Wrapper Types

Avoid creating wrapper types that just add fields to existing types. Instead, add scoped fields to the core type:

| ❌ Avoid                                         | ✅ Prefer                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `SpaceMember { user: User!, roles: [String!]! }` | `User.spaceRoles(spaceId: ID!): [String!]!`       |
| `Space.members: [SpaceMember!]!`                 | `Space.members: [User!]!` with `spaceRoles` field |

Benefits:

- Simpler schema with fewer types
- Consistent data shape - a User is always a User
- Easier caching and normalization in clients
- Fields can be queried in any context where the User is available

## Fragment Type Assertions

When using gql.tada/graphql-codegen with fragments, the generated TypeScript types use `$fragmentRefs` markers that don't expose fields like `id` directly. The fields exist at runtime, but TypeScript requires assertions:

```typescript
// TypeScript error: Property 'id' does not exist on type '{ __typename?: "User" } & { $fragmentRefs?: ... }'
const actorId = participant.id;

// Works - field exists at runtime, assertion satisfies TypeScript
const actorId = (participant as { id?: string })?.id;
```

This commonly occurs when working with fragment wrapper types from subscriptions or when comparing actors/participants by ID.
