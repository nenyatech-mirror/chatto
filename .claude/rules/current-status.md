## Project Maturity

Chatto has public servers running with real user data. Data migrations are required for any breaking changes to storage schemas or APIs. Never assume data can be discarded.

The 0.1.x event-sourcing architecture has been rolled out to all existing servers. The pre-0.1.0 boot importers and ES boot verifier have been removed; future storage-shape changes need their own explicit migration/rollout plan rather than relying on the old 0.0.x import path.

## Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

- Any changes to the `proto/` definitions are considered **SIGNIFICANT BREAKING CHANGES**. These affect compatibility with existing clients and servers, and require careful coordination for deployment.
- Read `.claude/rules/proto-compat.md` before changing `proto/`.
- Any changes to the GraphQL schema files in the `cli/internal/graph/` package should be considered **POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGES**. GraphQL is our primary API; at this point in the project we don't have external clients, though, but we should still tread carefully.
- Any changes to **NATS JetStream stream/KV schemas** (stream names, subject patterns, KV key formats) are **BREAKING CHANGES** that require a data migration path. Existing servers must be migrated on upgrade without data loss.
- All other changes can be considered non-breaking.
