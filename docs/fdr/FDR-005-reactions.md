# FDR-005: Reactions

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-13

## Overview

Users can react to a message with emoji. Reactions are aggregated into pills shown below the message body, displaying the emoji, a count, and whether the current user has reacted. Multiple users can react with the same emoji on the same message; clicking a pill toggles the current user's vote.

## Behavior

- Each pill shows: the emoji, how many users reacted with it, and a highlight when the current user has reacted.
- Hovering a pill shows a tooltip with up to 5 reactor names plus an overflow count.
- Clicking a pill toggles the current user's reaction.
- On desktop, hovering a message reveals a quick-reaction bar with the user's most recently used emojis (falling back to a default set if none have been used yet).
- Recent emoji selections persist in localStorage so the quick-bar stays personal across sessions.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Reactions key on message event ID

**Decision:** A reaction is keyed by the specific message event ID the user reacted to. A channel echo of a thread reply and the original thread reply are separate visible events, so they accumulate independent reaction state.
**Why:** Message identity lives on the EVT envelope. Keeping reactions attached to the exact envelope matches the GraphQL event model and avoids hidden canonicalization between two visible artifacts.
**Tradeoff:** A reply echoed into the channel can show different reaction counts in the channel and thread views. That is intentional: people are reacting to the appearance they can see.

### 2. Shortcodes, not raw Unicode

**Decision:** Reactions are stored as shortcode names like `thumbsup` or `heart`, drawn from the gemoji dataset (GitHub's emoji set). The frontend converts to display glyphs.
**Why:** NATS KV keys can't contain arbitrary Unicode, and storing the codepoint as a key would also lock us into one particular Unicode version's normalization rules. Shortcodes are stable, portable, and human-readable in storage.
**Tradeoff:** Emojis outside the gemoji set can't be used. The set is large enough that this rarely matters.

### 3. Durable events, in-memory projection is source of truth

**Decision:** Reaction add/remove changes append durable room-aggregate events to EVT (`evt.room.{roomId}.reaction_added` / `reaction_removed`). Current reaction state is derived by an in-memory projection keyed by message event ID, emoji shortcode, and actor/user ID. The projection consumes the room aggregate namespace so mutation snapshots can pair current reaction state with the room's applied OCC sequence. Live subscribers receive reactions through the EVT stream's `live.evt.>` republish path after projection readiness and authorization checks.
**Why:** Reactions are durable room facts. Keeping them in the room stream makes add/remove ordering explicit, gives replayable state, removes the old KV bucket from the hot read/write path, and lets duplicate add/remove decisions retry safely under multi-replica contention.
**Tradeoff:** The first projection version keeps all current reaction state in RAM and consumes more room facts than it derives. That is simple and correct; bounded or demand-loaded projections can follow once the rest of the event-sourcing architecture is in place and real access patterns are measured.

### 4. GraphQL exposes reactor names as a bounded preview

**Decision:** `ReactionSummary.count` is the total current count, while `ReactionSummary.users(first:)` returns a bounded preview of reacting users (default 3, max 10). The message UI asks for five preview users and renders any remaining count as overflow.
**Why:** Reaction pills need a quick hover tooltip, not an unbounded user directory embedded in every message event. Keeping the full count separate preserves the main signal while preventing popular reactions from inflating timeline payloads.
**Tradeoff:** Clients that need a complete reactor list will need a future dedicated paginated query instead of overloading the message timeline shape.

### 5. Quick-reaction recents are per-device, not per-user

**Decision:** The recent-reactions list lives in `localStorage`, not on the server.
**Why:** Server-side recents would mean a "your recents" query on every message hover (frequent and small) and a new write per reaction. Local storage is free and fast. The downside — losing recents between devices — is small relative to the cost.
**Tradeoff:** Recents don't sync across devices.

### 6. Reconnect catch-up uses resumable myEvents, not visible timeline rows

**Decision:** Missed reaction add/remove events are recovered through `Subscription.myEvents(after:)`. Durable EVT-backed subscription events carry a server-signed, user-bound opaque `deliveryCursor`; the web client remembers the latest cursor and passes it when the singleton event bus resubscribes after reconnect or wake.
**Why:** Reactions mutate existing message rows. If a client reconnects after missing only a reaction, visible timeline pagination has no new row to return. Replaying the raw durable reaction event through `myEvents` keeps the API model simple: queries fetch current projected state, and the subscription delivers the durable facts the client missed.
**Tradeoff:** Replay is limited to durable room EVT facts for rooms the user is currently a member of. Invalid, expired, or over-budget cursors force a full refresh from projected query state instead of replaying. Transient sync signals and presence changes remain live-only, and clients still refetch the affected message row when a replayed reaction arrives.
