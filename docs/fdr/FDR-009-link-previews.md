# FDR-009: Link Previews

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-15

## Overview

When a message contains a URL, Chatto can attach a preview card with the page's title, description, site name, and image. Previews are fetched client-driven while the user is composing — the user sees the preview before sending and can dismiss it.

## Behavior

- The composer fetches a link preview as soon as the user has typed a complete URL.
- Only the first URL in a message gets a preview. There is no multi-preview layout.
- URLs inside code spans, code blocks, pre-formatted text, and blockquotes do not trigger link previews.
- YouTube URLs get a specialized embed-ready card without scraping the page.
- A preview shows up in the composer with a dismiss button. Dismissing the preview prevents it from being attached to the sent message, and the dismissal is remembered for that URL during the composition session.
- When the message is sent, the preview data ships with it and is stored as part of the message body.
- Client-provided preview metadata is size-limited before storage: URL 2,048 bytes, title 300 bytes, description 1,000 bytes, image asset ID 15 bytes, site name 200 bytes, embed type 64 bytes, and embed ID 256 bytes.
- After posting, the message author can delete the preview from the message without deleting the message.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Preview fetching is client-driven, not server post-process

**Decision:** The composer queries for the preview during typing; the user explicitly accepts or dismisses before sending.
**Why:** Server-side preview generation after post is a worse user experience: previews appear seconds after the message, can't be dismissed before sending, and silently inflate every message with a URL. Client-driven puts control in the user's hands.
**Tradeoff:** Each compose session may make a preview query even if the user ends up not sending. Cost is small and capped (one URL per message).

### 2. One preview per message, first URL only

**Decision:** Only the first URL in a message gets a preview card. Subsequent URLs render as plain links.
**Why:** Multi-preview layouts (Slack-style) blow up the message height and are usually visual clutter. One preview captures the most-likely-relevant link.
**Tradeoff:** Messages that genuinely need to highlight several links can't. Authors can split into multiple messages.

### 3. 24-hour positive cache, 1-hour negative cache

**Decision:** Successful previews cache for 24 hours; failed fetches cache as failures for 1 hour.
**Why:** Web pages change, so unlimited positive caching would mean stale OpenGraph data. A 24-hour TTL is the usual balance. Negative caching is shorter because transient outages shouldn't lock us out for a day; but some caching is needed to avoid hammering unreachable sites.
**Tradeoff:** A site that updates its OpenGraph metadata sees stale previews for up to a day.

### 4. SSRF-safe fetcher with connection-time IP validation

**Decision:** All URL fetches go through an HTTP client that blocks private/loopback IP ranges. The IP check happens at connection time, not pre-check, to prevent DNS rebinding.
**Why:** Without these protections, a maliciously crafted URL could make the server fetch internal services. A pre-fetch DNS lookup is bypassable via rebinding; connection-time enforcement is not.
**Tradeoff:** Some legitimate internal-network use cases (preview an intranet wiki page) don't work. Operators who need that can disable previews entirely.

### 5. Preview images are downloaded, resized, and stored as server assets

**Decision:** Preview images are fetched once, resized to 1200×630 max, converted to WebP, and stored as assets on the Chatto server.
**Why:** Hot-linking preview images from third-party sites means broken previews when those sites change URLs, plus a privacy leak (the third party sees every Chatto user's fetch). Storing locally fixes both.
**Tradeoff:** Per-server storage cost. Acceptable given asset deduplication and the small fixed size cap.

### 6. Stored preview metadata is bounded

**Decision:** Preview metadata attached to a sent message is accepted only within generous per-field size limits.
**Why:** Preview data is client-provided at send time and stored with the message body. Bounding it keeps a single message from carrying arbitrarily large URL metadata.
**Tradeoff:** A page with unusually large metadata requires the client to trim or omit the preview before sending.

## Permissions

- Any authenticated user can fetch a link preview.
- Only the message author can delete a preview from their message.
