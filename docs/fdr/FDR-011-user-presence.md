# FDR-011: User Presence

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-23

## Overview

Every user has a presence status visible to others as a colored dot on their avatar: **Online**, **Away**, **Do Not Disturb**, or **Offline**. Presence is server-wide — a user has one status per Chatto server, not per space or room.

## Behavior

- When a user connects to a server (subscribes to the main event stream), the server sets that user's presence to Online and keeps the TTL refreshed.
- After 5 minutes without keyboard/mouse/touch input, the client transitions to Away.
- If the browser tab is hidden for 10 seconds, the client also transitions to Away (debounced to avoid flashing during quick tab switches).
- Any interaction returns the user to Online.
- Users can set Do Not Disturb for their current live server presence. Presence state is not persisted as a user preference.
- Disconnecting (closing the tab, network drop) does not send an active Offline signal. After 60 seconds without a heartbeat refresh, the presence entry expires and the user appears Offline.
- The presence dot updates across the UI as other users' statuses change, in real time.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Server-wide, not per-space

**Decision:** A user has one presence status across all spaces/rooms in a server.
**Why:** Anything else is confusing — "I'm online in #design but away in #engineering" doesn't match how presence works in any other chat tool. Per-server matches the user's actual session.
**Tradeoff:** Users can't selectively appear online for some rooms. They can mute rooms for notification purposes (see FDR-012) but not for presence.

### 2. Offline is inferred, not stored

**Decision:** Offline is the absence of a live presence record, not a stored state. The server refreshes the user's presence entry every 30 seconds; if all clients disconnect, the entry expires after 60 seconds via NATS KV TTL.
**Why:** A disconnecting client may not get the chance to send a clean "I'm offline" message (browser crash, network drop). Relying on TTL expiry handles all the failure modes uniformly.
**Tradeoff:** Up to a one-minute delay between "user closed the tab" and "the dot turns gray". This is the standard behavior in most chat apps and matches user expectations.

### 3. User-level live status with heartbeat-driven deduplication

**Decision:** Presence is stored in `MEMORY_CACHE` as `presence.{userId}`. A per-process PresenceHub watches these keys and emits live events only when the user-level status changes.
**Why:** Presence is a current-state hint, not per-tab/device domain state. Competing tabs/devices simply write the user's current live status; closing a tab does not actively write Offline, so another open tab can keep the TTL alive.
**Tradeoff:** The frontend has to clear its presence cache on reconnect, because it can't rely on incremental updates if it dropped a status-change event mid-flight.

### 4. Auto-away has two triggers (idle + tab hidden)

**Decision:** Two independent triggers transition to Away: 5 minutes of input inactivity, OR 10 seconds of tab hidden.
**Why:** Idle-only would miss the very common "switched tabs" case. Tab-hidden-only would mark people as away the moment they alt-tab to look at something. Combining both covers the realistic away cases.
**Tradeoff:** Some false positives — a user actively listening in another window is technically "away" by our model. Acceptable for the use case.

### 5. DND is live user state

**Decision:** Do Not Disturb is a live presence status for the user, not durable account state. It expires with presence and is not backed up or replayed from EVT. Durable custom statuses live separately as user profile metadata (FDR-022).
**Why:** Presence controls notification routing and "right now" UI hints. Persisting it as domain/account history would overstate its meaning, while custom statuses communicate user-authored profile context without changing availability.
**Tradeoff:** The UI has two adjacent concepts: live presence dot and durable custom status. They deliberately answer different questions.

### 6. Per-server tracking, with frontend coordination across servers

**Decision:** Each connected Chatto server tracks its own presence. The frontend's auto-away detector broadcasts the new status to all connected servers in parallel.
**Why:** Servers are independent and shouldn't have to coordinate among themselves — that would require cross-server discovery and trust. The client is already connected to all of them and can coordinate cheaply. See ADR-025.
**Tradeoff:** A user signed in from two different devices to the same server may have competing presence writers; the latest write wins until TTL expiry.

## Permissions

Presence status is public. Any authenticated user can see any other authenticated user's presence.
