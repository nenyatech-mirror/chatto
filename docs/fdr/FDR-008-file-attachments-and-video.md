# FDR-008: File Attachments & Video Processing

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-05-23

## Overview

Users can attach files to messages — images, videos, documents — via drag-and-drop, paste, or file picker. Images are dimensioned and resizable on the fly via signed URLs. Videos and animated GIFs are transcoded asynchronously into web-friendly quality variants.

## Behavior

- The composer accepts files via drag-and-drop, paste, and a file picker button.
- Draft attachments persist across room switches inside the same session.
- Default upload size limits: 25 MB for general files, 100 MB for videos when video processing is enabled.
- Images are inspected for dimensions at upload time and can be resized at render time via URL parameters (width, height, fit mode).
- Videos and animated GIFs are processed in the background. The message posts immediately; the video player appears once processing completes.
- Processing status: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED (or FAILED). Failed videos still show the original message; the UI surfaces an error state for the attachment.
- A thumbnail is generated from an early video frame.
- Resized images can be cached as WebP with an auto-expiring cache.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Dual storage backends (NATS ObjectStore + S3)

**Decision:** Attachments can be stored in NATS ObjectStore (default, good for development and small deployments) or in an S3-compatible bucket (production-grade). The retrieval layer tries both, with the configured primary first.
**Why:** Self-hosters running a single binary shouldn't have to spin up S3 just to send a screenshot. Larger operators need durable, replicated object storage. Supporting both lets us serve both ends of the spectrum. See ADR-021.
**Tradeoff:** Migration between backends is operator-managed. The "try both" retrieval logic adds a tiny overhead but greatly improves the migration experience.

### 2. Video processing is asynchronous and best-effort

**Decision:** A video upload doesn't block the message post. The message is posted immediately; transcoding happens in the background; a completion event refreshes the frontend.
**Why:** Synchronous transcoding would tie up an HTTP request for tens of seconds to minutes. Users expect messages to send instantly. The cost of "the video appears a moment later" is much lower than "your chat froze for a minute".
**Tradeoff:** Users see a "processing" placeholder until transcoding finishes. Failures surface as an error state on the attachment, not as a failed message.

### 3. Animated GIFs go through the video pipeline

**Decision:** Animated GIFs are detected at upload and routed to the video transcoder rather than served as raw images.
**Why:** Animated GIF files are typically much larger than equivalent MP4s, and they're inefficient to decode in browsers. Transcoding to MP4 produces smaller, smoother playback.
**Tradeoff:** A static thumbnail is shown until processing finishes, even for GIFs that would have rendered immediately as-is. Worth it for the playback experience and bandwidth savings.

### 4. Quality variants are selected per source

**Decision:** Transcoding produces multiple H.264 MP4 variants whose target resolutions are derived from the source resolution. A 1080p source might yield 720p and 480p; a 480p source skips the higher tiers.
**Why:** Producing tiers higher than the source is pointless (upscaling is lossy without benefit). Producing tiers near the source is bandwidth waste for the common case.
**Tradeoff:** No HLS / adaptive bitrate streaming — the frontend picks a variant based on viewport and connection at the time of play. Acceptable for chat-context videos.

### 5. Originals are replaced by variants after transcoding

**Decision:** After transcoding succeeds, the original upload is deleted and only the encoded variants are kept. Variants and the generated thumbnail are full `Attachment` protos, embedded directly into the message's `VideoProcessingState` proto (`VideoProcessingState.thumbnail_attachment` and `VideoVariant.attachment`).
**Why:** Originals are uncompressed-ish source files that nobody needs to download. Keeping them around would double or triple storage cost for no benefit. Embedding the variant Attachment protos into the VPS makes the VPS the self-contained source of truth for variant metadata — the URL handler can read storage location, content-type, and dimensions from there directly without a separate index lookup.
**Tradeoff:** Lossy. If we ever wanted to re-transcode with new settings, we couldn't recover the original. Considered acceptable given the cost ratio.

### 6. Attachment URLs encode authorization claims into the URL itself

**Decision:** Every attachment URL is a signed locator — `/assets/attachments/{base64payload}.{hexHMAC}`. The payload encodes the room ID, the source-of-truth pointer (the owning `MessageBody`'s KV key for body attachments, or the parent video's attachment ID for variants/thumbnails), and the attachment ID. Transform URLs append the existing signed transform-path component on top.
**Why:** A self-describing URL lets the HTTP handler authorize and serve without a second KV namespace for attachment metadata. The body (or VPS) stays the only copy of the `Attachment` proto, the HMAC prevents URL forgery, and the per-request auth chain (session + room membership) is still what actually grants access. See ADR-032 for the full rationale.
**Tradeoff:** URLs are longer (~150 chars vs ~30) and individually irrevocable — rotating `[core.assets].signing_secret` invalidates *every* URL at once. Per-request auth makes URL leaks non-load-bearing; rotation impact is bounded because URLs are regenerated on every GraphQL response.

## Permissions

No separate upload permission. Posting an attachment requires room membership and the relevant message-posting permission (`message.post` or `message.post-in-thread`).
