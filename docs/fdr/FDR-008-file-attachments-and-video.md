# FDR-008: File Attachments & Video Processing

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-17

## Overview

Users can attach files to messages — images, videos, documents — via drag-and-drop, paste, or file picker. Images are dimensioned and resizable on the fly via signed URLs. When video processing is enabled, videos and animated GIFs are transcoded into web-friendly quality variants.

## Behavior

- The composer accepts files via drag-and-drop, paste, and a file picker button when the viewer has `message.attach`.
- Draft attachments persist across room switches inside the same session.
- Default upload size limits: 25 MB for general files, 100 MB for videos when video processing is enabled.
- Video uploads require server-side video processing to be enabled. When it is disabled, the composer rejects `video/*` files immediately and the GraphQL mutation rejects them before storage.
- Images are inspected for dimensions at upload time and can be resized at render time via URL parameters (width, height, fit mode). GraphQL exposes transform parameters for attachments and user avatars; public server branding images expose canonical URLs only.
- When enabled, videos and animated GIFs are processed by the current server process after asset creation and message submission scheduling. This is best-effort and intentionally simple until a real durable worker queue exists.
- Processing status: durable STARTED / COMPLETED / FAILED outcomes are stored as asset aggregate events (`evt.asset.{assetId}.*`) and delivered through the normal live EVT subscription path after room-membership authorization. There is no separate `video_processed` live event or new runtime KV state for video progress; failed videos still show the original message, and the UI falls back to the original upload when it is available.
- A thumbnail is generated from an early video frame.
- Resized images can be cached as WebP with an auto-expiring cache.
- In Service Worker-controlled browser sessions, stable asset URLs are rendered as same-origin virtual URLs and proxied to the owning server with the user's registered server credentials. Successful full responses are cached privately in the browser; media `Range` requests bypass that cache.
- Active document attachment types such as HTML, XHTML, SVG, and XML can still be uploaded and viewed inline, but original-file responses are delivered in a browser sandbox so uploaded scripts do not run as trusted Chatto application code.
- The room sidebar Files panel lists current accessible attachments from both root messages and thread replies, grouped by date as Today, Yesterday, This week, This month, then older calendar months. Rows show a thumbnail or file-type icon, filename, and upload time; selecting a root-message attachment jumps the room timeline to that message, while selecting a thread-reply attachment opens the thread pane and highlights the reply.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Dual storage backends (NATS ObjectStore + S3)

**Decision:** Attachments can be stored in NATS ObjectStore (default, good for development and small deployments) or in an S3-compatible bucket (production-grade). Each asset records its storage backend and logical key at upload time; S3 deployments may add a configurable object-key prefix that is applied only at the S3 client boundary.
**Why:** Self-hosters running a single binary shouldn't have to spin up S3 just to send a screenshot. Larger operators need durable, replicated object storage. Supporting both lets us serve both ends of the spectrum. See ADR-021.
**Tradeoff:** Migration between backends or S3 prefixes is operator-managed. Stored asset keys remain prefix-free so moving objects between S3 base paths does not require rewriting Chatto metadata.

### 2. Video processing is in-process and best-effort

**Decision:** The current implementation asks the process-local video service to spawn a goroutine from the message command path after `AssetCreatedEvent` has been appended and `AssetProcessingStartedEvent` has been recorded. It does not publish a NATS processing request and does not create runtime KV progress/claim records.
**Why:** The previous transient pub/sub worker path added queue semantics without giving us durable delivery or a clean multi-process claim model. A direct call is easier to reason about and easier to replace later with a real durable queue.
**Tradeoff:** This is intentionally best-effort. If the process crashes mid-transcode, boot recovery scans the EVT projection and retries unmanifested video assets. Multi-process duplicate work is possible until a future durable worker design adds explicit claims.

### 3. Animated GIFs go through the video pipeline

**Decision:** When video processing is enabled, animated GIFs are detected at upload and routed to the video transcoder rather than served as raw images. When video processing is disabled, GIFs remain allowed as image uploads.
**Why:** Animated GIF files are typically much larger than equivalent MP4s, and they're inefficient to decode in browsers. Transcoding to MP4 produces smaller, smoother playback.
**Tradeoff:** A static thumbnail is shown until processing finishes, even for GIFs that would have rendered immediately as-is. Worth it for the playback experience and bandwidth savings.

### 4. Quality variants are selected per source

**Decision:** Transcoding produces multiple H.264 MP4 variants whose target resolutions are derived from the source resolution. A 1080p source might yield 720p and 480p; a 480p source skips the higher tiers.
**Why:** Producing tiers higher than the source is pointless (upscaling is lossy without benefit). Producing tiers near the source is bandwidth waste for the common case.
**Tradeoff:** No HLS / adaptive bitrate streaming yet — the frontend picks a variant based on viewport and connection at the time of play. Adaptive streaming is tracked separately in GitHub issue #668.

### 5. Attachments are declared content; derivative manifests are durable events

**Decision:** `AssetCreatedEvent` records each uploaded or generated binary as a first-class `Asset` on `evt.asset.{assetId}.asset_created`. `Asset` carries inline storage and flat media metadata such as dimensions, duration, and bitrate; room scope and ownership context (`message`, `derivative`, `user_avatar`) live on `AssetCreatedEvent`. Processing outcome events reference asset IDs instead of embedding derivative asset metadata, and are appended to the same asset aggregate. Message posting imperatively invokes process-local video processing for newly uploaded video/animated-GIF assets after their asset creation events are appended; boot recovery derives any missed work from the asset and room projections and uses the same local processor path. After transcoding succeeds, the original upload is retained as source content, and generated thumbnails/MP4 variants are appended as derivative `AssetCreatedEvent`s whose owner points at the original asset. Durable failed/unavailable outcomes are recorded with `AssetProcessingFailedEvent.failure_code`; GraphQL maps the source-missing enum to the stable `original_missing` reason for clients. Beta 0.1.0 histories that already wrote asset lifecycle facts under `evt.room.{roomId}.asset_*` remain readable through the asset projection's legacy subscription lanes.
**Why:** Attachments and video derivatives are content metadata, not runtime state. Making assets their own aggregates gives projections a single asset graph (`message -> original asset -> derivative assets`), keeps binary lifecycle facts out of the room aggregate, and lets future uploads exist outside messages without a parallel asset model. Keeping the original allows future re-encoding, and storing processing outcomes in EVT lets processed playback survive projection rebuilds and storage-boundary cleanup.
**Tradeoff:** Retaining originals costs more storage than the old replace-after-transcode behavior. Processing execution is still operational, not durable; a crash between the durable asset event and a completed processing outcome is repaired by boot recovery rather than by treating `AssetCreatedEvent` as a live subscriber trigger. Moving new writes from room aggregates to asset aggregates means older beta binaries must not be rolled back after new asset-subject writes have occurred; compatibility is maintained by this and later versions reading both subject shapes, not by rewriting history.

### 6. Attachment URLs are per-user signed capabilities

**Decision:** GraphQL exposes attachment media as stable asset paths plus per-user access tickets: `/assets/files/{assetId}?access={ticket}` for originals and `/assets/files/{assetId}/image/{width}x{height}/{fit}?access={ticket}` for image derivatives. `Attachment.assetUrl` / `thumbnailAssetUrl`, video thumbnail URLs, and variant URLs also expose the ticket expiry so the client can refresh before or after a lazy-load miss. Every fetch verifies the signed user is still a member of the asset's room.
**Why:** Cross-origin `<img>` tags (used when the SPA loads attachments from a *remote* registered server) can't carry session cookies (SameSite) or Authorization headers. A signed per-user access ticket lets browsers load remote attachments directly, while the room-membership check still auto-revokes access on kick/leave.
**Tradeoff:** The access ticket is still a bearer capability — anyone holding it can fetch until the expiry passes or the signed user loses room membership. `core.AssetAccessTicketTTL` is currently **1 hour** so normal rendering, lazy loading, media startup, and lightbox use are reliable; clients refresh URL fields via GraphQL when tickets approach expiry or a media load fails. In Service Worker-controlled sessions, the DOM uses non-portable same-origin virtual URLs under `/__chatto/assets/{serverId}/...`; the worker keeps the ticketed target URL out of markup, fetches through the registered server credentials when possible, and caches full successful responses in a private per-browser cache. This removes the "lazy copy URL grants access" problem for the main web app, while keeping ticketed URLs as fallback for non-Service-Worker clients and for media `Range` redirects. Legacy `/assets/attachments/{signedLocator}` URLs remain supported for compatibility/internal fallback and use the shorter 5-minute locator TTL. Rotating `[core.assets].signing_secret` invalidates all outstanding tickets and legacy locators at once.

### 7. Active document attachments render in a browser sandbox

**Decision:** Original attachment responses for active document formats (HTML, XHTML, SVG, XML, and XML-derived media types) include a CSP sandbox and `nosniff`. S3-backed attachments of those types stream through Chatto instead of redirecting directly to a presigned object URL, so the same response policy applies.
**Why:** Some teams need to share these file types inline, but uploaded active content must not become trusted Chatto application code. A sandbox without same-origin privileges preserves the viewing use case while preventing the easiest same-origin stored-XSS path.
**Tradeoff:** Scripts, forms, top-level navigation, and same-origin APIs are restricted inside uploaded active documents. S3 deployments also lose the zero-copy redirect fast path for those active document types, while ordinary media files keep it.

### 8. Room Files panel is a read projection, not durable attachment state

**Decision:** `Room.attachments` exposes a paginated list of current message attachments for a room. The read walks the visible room timeline projection, folds current message bodies, includes thread replies, preserves attachment order within each message, and sorts by newest message first.
**Why:** Files should disappear from the sidebar when their message body is retracted or the attachment is removed. Deriving the list from the existing room/message projections keeps the panel consistent with the timeline without adding duplicate durable state.
**Tradeoff:** There is no search or media filtering in this iteration. Clients page through the current list and refresh it after attachment-affecting live events.

## Permissions

Posting an attachment requires room membership, the relevant message-posting permission (`message.post` or `message.post-in-thread`), and `message.attach`. The `message.attach` permission is configurable at server, group, and room scope and only gates message attachments; server branding uploads, user avatars, link previews, and attachment deletion use their existing checks.

Fresh servers seed `message.attach` for `everyone` so new deployments keep uploads enabled by default. Existing servers are not automatically backfilled after upgrade; operators should grant `message.attach` manually or through their chosen RBAC maintenance flow if existing rooms should keep allowing uploads.
