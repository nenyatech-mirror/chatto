# ADR-032: Self-Describing Signed Attachment URLs

**Date:** 2026-05-23

## Context

Attachment metadata (room ID, storage location, filename, dimensions) for a posted file lives embedded inside its owning `MessageBody` proto in `SERVER_BODIES`. The asset HTTP handler at `/assets/attachments/...` needs three things on every request:

1. **The room ID**, to authorize the caller against room membership.
2. **A pointer to the source-of-truth proto** (which body the attachment belongs to, or which `VideoProcessingState` it came from in the case of a transcoded variant or thumbnail).
3. **The attachment ID**, to pick the right attachment out of that source proto.

The previous design (introduced in #575) answered all three by maintaining a second copy of the `Attachment` proto as a standalone record at `attachment.{roomId}.{attachmentId}` in `SERVER_BODIES`. The HTTP handler took the attachment ID from the URL, did a wildcard filter lookup on the records bucket, and read everything else off the matched record.

That design solved the original problem — the prior `roomID == "" → allow` shortcut on the S3 fast path was a real auth bypass — but it introduced a duplication: every `Attachment` proto was now persisted twice (once inside its body, once standalone). Two copies is a drift surface for any future mutation, and a write-amplification cost at upload time.

The options for fixing the duplication:

- **Standalone record is the source of truth.** Body holds attachment IDs only; the record holds the full proto. Inverts the relationship; loses the "a message edit re-renders its attachments naturally" invariant; requires N record fetches per message render.
- **Embedded copy is the source of truth, with a thin index.** Body owns the proto; the standalone bucket reduces to a pointer (e.g., body key + attachment ID). HTTP handler does index → body fetch → attachment scan. Still two writes per upload (binary + index), still a second KV namespace to maintain.
- **Encode the lookup pointer into the URL itself.** Eliminate the index entirely. URL carries the room ID, source-of-truth pointer (body key or video-origin attachment ID), and attachment ID; signed so attackers can't craft URLs for arbitrary IDs.

## Decision

Adopt the third option. **Attachment URLs are self-describing signed locators.** No separate index bucket; the URL itself carries everything the HTTP handler needs to authorize and serve.

### URL shape

Original:

```
/assets/attachments/{base64payload}.{hexHMAC}
```

Transformed (image resize):

```
/assets/attachments/{base64payload}.{hexHMAC}/t/{base64params}.{hexHMAC}
```

`base64payload` decodes to JSON `{r, b?, v?, a}`:

- `r` — room ID (for the authz check)
- `b` — message body key `{userId}.{bodyId}` (set for body-embedded attachments; exactly one of `b` or `v` is set)
- `v` — video-origin attachment ID (set for variants and thumbnails; the VPS is keyed by this ID)
- `a` — the attachment ID itself

`hexHMAC` is the first 16 bytes (32 hex chars) of HMAC-SHA256 of the base64 payload using `[core.assets].signing_secret` — the same secret as the transform-URL signing in [ADR-023](ADR-023-hmac-signed-image-transform-urls.md). The transform component, when present, retains its existing signing scheme with the locator string as its first resource ID.

### HTTP handler flow

1. Parse the path segment, verify the locator signature, decode the payload. Invalid signature → 403.
2. Look up the session cookie. No session → 401.
3. Resolve the room kind from `r` and verify `RoomMembershipExists(kind, userID, r)`. Not a member → 403.
4. Dispatch by source: `FindBodyAttachment(b, a)` for body attachments, `FindVideoOriginAttachment(v, a)` for variants/thumbnails. Missing → 404.
5. Read `Storage` off the returned proto and serve (presigned S3 redirect or NATS stream).

No standalone-record bucket is consulted.

### Source-of-truth changes

- **Body attachments**: the embedded proto in `MessageBody.Attachments` is the only copy. `PostMessage` stamps `MessageBodyId` on each attachment before persisting the body so URL generation has the back-pointer at hand. Bodies persisted before this field existed get the back-pointer patched in on read by the GraphQL resolver (and stamped permanently on the next edit). A boot migration (`BackfillAttachmentLocatorData`) does the same for existing bodies to make backend operations work too.
- **Video variants and thumbnails**: full `Attachment` protos are now embedded into `VideoProcessingState.thumbnail_attachment` and `VideoVariant.attachment`. The video processor populates them on transcode completion. A boot migration backfills these from the prior standalone records on existing instances.

## Consequences

- **One source of truth per attachment.** No write-amplification, no drift surface. A message-body mutation (rare today, but a possibility tomorrow) updates the only copy.
- **No second KV namespace.** `SERVER_BODIES` reverts to holding just bodies. The existing `attachment.*` records are dead weight that a future PR can sweep; they stay on disk for now because the boot migration reads them as a data source for the VPS backfill.
- **Authorization surface unchanged.** Every request still authenticates and checks room membership; signature only prevents forgery. A leaked URL doesn't grant standalone access; auto-revocation on kick or attachment-delete still works.
- **Forgery prevention.** The previous URL shape (`/assets/attachments/{id}`) let attackers probe arbitrary attachment IDs to enumerate the space. The locator URL requires a valid HMAC; only IDs the server has issued URLs for can be tested.
- **Longer URLs.** ~150 chars vs ~30. Irrelevant for our use case (URLs aren't human-typed and aren't shared as bare share-links outside the app).
- **URLs aren't individually revocable.** Rotating `[core.assets].signing_secret` invalidates *all* URLs at once. Auth is rechecked per request, so a leak doesn't grant standalone access — the URL only lets the attacker try, and the membership check still has to pass. If we ever want share links with TTLs or single-use semantics, we'd extend the payload (e.g., add an `exp` claim); none of that is needed today.
- **No `exp` claim.** Locators are valid as long as the secret is. We considered adding a deliberate expiration but: attachments are immutable, URLs are regenerated on every GraphQL response, and per-request auth is the actual access control. An expiration would only force more URL churn without adding security.
- **Operational: secret rotation invalidates in-flight URLs.** Currently-loaded pages would 404 their image requests after a rotation until the user navigates and re-renders. Frontend URL emission is on every GraphQL response, so the impact is bounded to "until next page transition." Worth a runbook note.
- **Cleaner internal API.** `GetAttachmentReader(*Attachment)` and `DeleteAttachmentFromStorage(*Attachment)` take the proto directly; the previous `(spaceID, attachmentID)` shape and the multi-layout S3 key probing are gone. Reads `Storage.S3.Key` straight off the proto.
